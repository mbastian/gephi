OpenOrd.description = Layout algorithm for very large undirected graphs, based on Frutcherman-Reingold. The algorithm uses edge-cutting to better distinguich clusters, therefore the quality of the result depends on the type of graph. It can be run in parallel to speed up computing.

OpenOrd.properties.edgecut.name = Edge Cut
OpenOrd.properties.edgecut.description = 0 means no cutting and 1 maximum cutting. A higher cutting means a more clustered result.

OpenOrd.properties.numthreads.name = Num Threads
OpenOrd.properties.numthreads.description = The number of threads to use to run the algorithm. Increase this number for multi-core computers. It's recommened to put the number of core minus 1 to keep a thread for display.

OpenOrd.properties.numiterations.name = Num Iterations
OpenOrd.properties.numiterations.description = Increase this number only for very large graphs. More iterations, more time it takes and less dense the result will be. Minimum is 100 iterations, and default is 750.

OpenOrd.properties.resetposition.name = Reset Position
OpenOrd.properties.resetposition.description = Reset the position at the algorithm startup. Uncheck this if you wanna layout new nodes on a previously layouted graph.

OpenOrd.properties.seed.name = Random seed
OpenOrd.properties.seed.description = The result of the algorithm depends on the seed, the number of iterations and the number of threads.
